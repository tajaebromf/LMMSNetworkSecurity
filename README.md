# LMMs NetworkSecurity


Utilize multiple LLMs to assist students in writing and optimizing P4 code.
Develop AI-enhanced security policies for network protection.
Test security strategies against various cyberattack models.
Validate results using Mininet or real-world experimental testbeds.

## Methodologies
1. Select multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek) for
comparison.
2. Use LLMs to generate P4-based networking security strategies.
3. Simulate and deploy these strategies in Mininet or real-world testbeds.
4. Conduct security assessments against various cyberattacks (e.g.,
DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Packet Injection).
5. Evaluate effectiveness based on attack mitigation performance and
efficiency.
